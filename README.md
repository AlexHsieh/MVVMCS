# MVVMC with storyboard

MVVM is one of replacement of MVC. One of con that MVX pattern not addressing is view navigation. Neither does MVVM. Therefore, there is MVVMC mentioned. C as coordinator is to separate navigation from view controller . When using MVVMC we find out it wonâ€™t be able to use storyboard. All benefits such as binding, autolayout with better maintainability and visibility lost when coordinator joined in.

This sample project shows how we can still integrate storyboard with MVVMC. See detail description from below link.
